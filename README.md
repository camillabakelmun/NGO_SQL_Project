# NGO_SQL_Project
Advanced SQL Project for an NGO: "Global Development Insights" analyses global population and development metrics data to guide humanitarian aid and sustainable development initiatives.
Overview
This project is a self-guided SQL exploration based on Khan Academy’s resources, designed to simulate real-world data analysis for a hypothetical NGO: Global Development Insights.

The NGO focuses on analysing global population and development metrics to identify trends, guide humanitarian aid, and promote sustainable development. This project addresses questions like:

What are the average, maximum, and minimum values across key metrics?
How do these metrics vary by category?
What new insights can we uncover by grouping or filtering the data?
Purpose
By practising advanced SQL techniques, this project demonstrates how data analysis can support NGOs in:

Identifying trends: Highlighting regions with rapid growth, migration challenges, or demographic shifts.
Guiding aid allocation: Targeting resources where they are most needed.
Supporting sustainable development: Recommending policies to improve quality of life.

Key SQL Skills Practised
Aggregate functions: Finding averages, maximums, and minimums.
HAVING clause: Grouping data by meaningful categories.
CASE statements: Creating new classifications from existing data.
Filtering with AND/OR: Isolating specific trends for targeted insights.
Potential Use Cases
The findings from this project could help Global Development Insights to:

Address population density and resource challenges.
Guide policies on migration and integration.
Focus on regions with significant demographic changes.
Develop targeted programs to support sustainable growth.
Inspiration
This project is based on Khan Academy's SQL project, where I have been enhancing my SQL skills.
